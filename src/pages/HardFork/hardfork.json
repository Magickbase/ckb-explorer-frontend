    "content": "What is a Hard Fork? A hard fork is a significant update to a blockchain protocol that permanently diverges from its previous version. It introduces non-backward-compatible changes, requiring all network nodes to upgrade. If most nodes update successfully by the designated epoch number, the fork is deployed. Nodes running outdated versions lose connectivity, as they follow old rules that no longer apply.",

    "content": "Purpose of a Hard Fork: Nervos CKB implements hard forks to enhance the networkâ€™s functionality and security. These upgrades introduce new capabilities such as modified data structures, RISC-V extensions, and new syscalls. Hard forks also resolve critical issues, fix security vulnerabilities, and address protocol limitations that cannot be patched through backward-compatible updates, ensuring the long-term stability and growth of the platform.",

First, a proposal is created, discussed, and finalized, followed by implementation and local testing, taking about nine months. Next, the update is deployed on a public preview network and testnet for further stability testing. Finally, after a three-month preparation period, the fork is activated on the mainnet, ensuring a smooth transition.",
